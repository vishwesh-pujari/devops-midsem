Create 2 VMs using Terraform.
See on virt-manager what their IPs are (by gng into the VM and ifconfiging)
Write the inventory file in local directory. Specify appropriate IPs

Use modules for writing tasks

vi /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg   # configuration file
Default configuration file which ansible picks up.

#gathering = implicit
ansible gathers system information(os, hw infor) about the server which is going to be configured before connecting to it .

If we specify environment var, then we will override the vars in the main config file.

Configuration File Precedence:
The name of file MUST be ansible.cfg

View Configurations:
Facts: -> we can get information about system.

tasks:
- debug:
    var: ansible_facts   # gathers all facts

Here, debug is a module

hosts:localhost means it will run the play on ControlNode.


How to stop gathering facts
- name: .....
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: no
  tasks:
  - debug:
      var: ansible_facts
      
      
Modules in Ansible:
Go to Command Modules on the documentation 

Inside of tasks, we specify module. That module takes something as input.
eg. debug is a module, it takes ansible_Facts as input. And debug module simply prints it.

tasks:
  - name: Execute command 'date'
    command: date     # this is the command module, it executes the command as date
    

In the inventory file, the alias of the name is {{inventory_hostname}}

ansible.builtin.hostname:     # hostname is a builtin module.
	name="{{inventory_hostname}}"
	
	
By default gathering facts is enabled.

ansible -m ping all
-m : to invoke a certain module
all : hosts


ansible -m ping -i ./inventoryfile all

Inside the file:

tasks:
	ping:
	
We have an archive and unarchive module.
We also have a copy module

Cron Job
cron is the module

- hosts: all
  tasks:
  - name: Created a scheduled task
    cron:
      name: Run daily health report
      job: sh /opt/scripts/health.sh
      month: 2
      day: 19
      hour: 8
      minute: 10
      
mount module.

file module.
state: directory   # means creates directory
state: touch     # creates empty file.

idempotency is very imp in ansible

firewalld module.

lineinfile module.

tasks:
  - lineinfile:
      path: /etc/resolv.conf
      line: 'nameserver 10.1.250.10'

Ansible checks whether such a line exists in the file, if not, adds it. idempotency.
