Validate whether playbook is valid:
$ ansible-playbook playbook.yml --check

On default, execution of tasks is linear.
If we want to skip some tasks, then we can using --start-at-task while running command.

Tags:
tasks:
- yum:
    name: httpd
    state: installed
  tags: install

We can use this tag, to run only a certain part of the task
--tags "install"
--skip-tags "install"

Variables in Ansible:
Jinja format: {{}}

In the inventory file:
[web_servers:vars]
dns_server=10.5.5.3

This variable is available for all web_servers.

Host level variable declaration. Group level variable declaration.

Play vars means whatever vars are specified in playbook.


Register Variables:
tasks:
- shell: cat /etc/hosts
  register: result   # store result in register variable
- debug:
    var: result    # print the result.
    
    
Magic Variables:
Inbuilt vars

hostvars  - gives all variables for all hosts
groups   - gives all hosts in a specific group


shell:
shell module is to execute commands.


Conditionals:

apt:
  name: nginx
  state: present
when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"


So apt will be executed when the os fam is Debian

tasks:
- command: service httpd status
    register: result
- mail:
    to: mailid
    subject: .....
    body: ....
  when: result.stdout.find('down') != -1

mail module is executed only if when condn is true.


Loops:
See the loop.yml file.

state:present means at the end of invoking a command, the package must be present.



Blocks: Groups tasks
less block.yml


Error Handling:
less error.yml


Task Failure:
any_errors_fatal : true   # if there is any error in the task, then ansible doesn't execute furthur tasks.

less fail.yml
