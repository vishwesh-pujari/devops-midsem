Write Code -> Git -> Github -> Jenkins Pipeline (Build automatically) -> Run on docker / kubernets.

Infrastructure as Code:
How to create infrastructure? How to create VMs where K8S clusters will be hosted?
Automating process of creating infrastructure.

HCL -> language specification for terraform

IAC -> Infra as Code
1. Config management - 
	We already have VM. We just want to install something or config anything
	eg Ansible, SaltStack, Puppet
2. Server Templating -
	
	eg docker, packer, vagrant
3. Provisioning Tools -
	eg Terraform, CloudFormation
	
Terraform has rich set of plugins called providers.
registry.terraform.io  -> list of all providers.
https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/intro

$ virt-manager

AWS like providers provide APIs to create VMs etc from COde.
Terraform is a declarative language(just specify what u want). Terraform provider calls the APIs.

In HCL language: 
resource -> bcoz we have to automate the process of creating resources
"aws_instance" -> aws is provider, instance is ec2 instance

.tf extension

resource "local_file"    means local is provider and resourcefile is file. https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/local/latest/docs

resource "local_file" "games" {
	filename = "/tmp/favourite-games"
	content = "FIFA 21"
}

Providers are just plugins.

$ terraform -h
$ terraform init  -> prepares Working Directory for other commands
$ terraform validate
$ terraform plan
$ terraform apply


Run $ terraform init
It will install the hashicorp/local bcoz we specified "local_file"
All providers are downloaded in ./.terraform

Run $ terraform plan
Terraform creates the resource for us.

Run $ terraform apply
terraform.tfstate file is created.
Gives complete list of all resources managed by terraform script

Now check
$ ls /tmp
$ cat /tmp/favorite-games


$ terraform destroy
$ ls /tmp

content is an attribute.
.tfstate is used for tracking current changes. This is done bcoz it is not possible always to use AWS API to get what is exactly being run.
terraform compares the .tf file and .tfstate file.

The plugin is related to the ENVIRONMENT WHERE WE WANT TO SET THE INFRA

Infra means
VM, Network associated with that VM, Firewall, etc.
