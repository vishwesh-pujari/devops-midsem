Ansible - Configuration Management
idempotency

Go to ansible community documentation
ansible scripts are yaml based.

Once we have infrastructure ready, and we want to configure -> then use ansible.
From same ansible script, we can manage multiple nodes.

Control Node -> Where ansible is installed. Separate VM. Separate dedicated node.

less /etc/ansible/hosts

Create 2 VMs using terraform.

in yaml file, each section is called play
It is a playbook

We can write our own inventory file and pass it while running ansible
$ ansible-playbook change_hostname.yaml -i inventoryfile

We can group hosts/vms in the inventory file.
Benefits of grouping?

- hosts: db   # this means only apply the below tasks to hosts listed under "db".

How to write inventory?
web1 ansible_host=... ansible_connection=... ....
This web1 is an alias for the VM. It can be anything. it doesnt need to be same as its hostname.

ansible_host=<ip or fully qualified name>
