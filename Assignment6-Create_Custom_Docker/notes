How to create a custom dockerfile for php - https://hub.docker.com/_/php

How to start a local PHP server in a directory? php -S localhost:3000
However after CMD in docker file we localhost doesn't work. We have to mention
CMD ["php", "-S", "0.0.0.0:3000"]

While running the docker image, use port mapping of 3000:3000
Bcoz on our host machine we are going to request on 3000, and in the container the server is running on 3000
If in the container the php server was running on 4000, then we would have to specify the port mapping as 3000:4000
