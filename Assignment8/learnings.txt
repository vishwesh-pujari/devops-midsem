Nodes in a cluster have a limit on "allocatable resources"
$ kubectl get nodes
$ kubectl describe node <node-name>
 - see the capacity and allocatable resources.

In this assignment, I was creating 2 pods, each taking 2 cpus. But the problem was, that the minikube control plane node can at max allocate only 2 cpus. Hence the second pod wasn't running.

Total "limits" may be over 100 percent, i.e., overcommitted. i.e. multiple pods on a node can request limits which are greater than the allocatable resources.
However the total "requests" of all pods must be less than the allocatable resources of all nodes on that pod.

cpu: 800m  # m here means milli. 800 millicpu




$ minikube ssh 

- after entering the cluster, you can directly ping or curl to the IP addresses of the services / pods without doing port forwarding and all.
