Go to EC2 console: Create a new Ubuntu Instance.
You can see the instance on Lightsail. You can also see if it is running or closed. Note that the instance is FREE FOR THE FIRST 3 MONTHS AFTER CREATING IT ONLY.

Click on the terminal icon of that machine, install apache server, vim, etc. Write a new HTML file in /var/www/html
You can see the public IP of that ubuntu machine. If you type that public IP in the window, you will be able to see the website!
To see the url corresponding to the public IP: type:
host <public-ip>
OR
nslookup <public-ip>
